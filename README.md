# mantis-mono

## 1) Start the project

Initialized with command:
```
npx degit matt3224/sapper-start mantis-mono
```

After setting up git and first commit, `npm install` and `npm run dev`

It works.

## 2) One small step for man...

Playing with rollup/polka/sapper.middleware to make them serve api routes.
Works only with double path (/e/e) ... whatever.

Adding some routes to show:

It works.
